# MUST READ

There is a problem when I upload the files, it gets uploaded without the zuck file, and thus the application won't work

to fix this issue, open the project directory and run this command in terminal
`cd static/zuck && git clone https://github.com/ramon82/zuck.js .`

if it gave you any error then run both of them separatly like so
`cd static/zuck`
`git clone https://github.com/ramon82/zuck.js .`

Enjoy :)
